## Description
The webapp contains allows one to post a quote using the form and vote on other posted quotes displayed on the side.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The github page is currently live thus the following link will take you to the webpage "https://donaldkiplagat.github.io/Quotes/"
* As long as you have a compatible browser the document will work.

### Known Bugs
The Panels can't hold a large quote inside it thus will overflow.

### Behaviour Driven Development
* The program should return "(Title name) is required" when the user leaves a form value empty.<br> 
Input Example:" "<br>
Output Example: "Author is required

* When the user clicks on the like or dislike buttons the value beside it should increase by 1.<br>
Input Example:(click "like")<br>
Output Example: Like = +1<br>

* When the user click on "Add Quote" the values entered in the form should be displayed on the right side.<br>
Input Example: Title=Me, Author=You, Quote= Us<br>
Output Exaple: Me, You, Us

* When the "Delete" button is clicked the parent quote will be deleted.


### Technologies Used
* HTML was used in making the skeleton of the website.
* CSS was used in styling the document.
* Atom was the source code editor of choice.
* Git and Github were used as my local and online repositories respectively.
* AngularCLI was used in creating the components/classes/directives/pipes needed in the web-app


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
